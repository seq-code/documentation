## Register Lists

Names submitted for evaluation before or after publication need to be
submitted as part of a register list. This list may include more than one
name, and it is recommended that all names appearing in the same effective
publication are added to a single list. Each register list has a unique
accession in the form of <b>"seqco.de/r:xxxxxxxx"</b> which can be reported in
manuscripts in preparation or submitted for peer-review. This list facilitates
curator's review in the Registry and ensures that names appearing in the same
effective publication are all validated at the same time.
