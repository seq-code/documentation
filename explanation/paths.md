Refers to the process of registering a name in the SeqCode Registry while the
manuscript is still in preparation or undergoing peer-review. This is the
recommended process of registration, as it reduces the need for future errata or
discrepancies between the published version of a protologue and
the information in the SeqCode Registry.

## Path 2
Refers to the registration of a name in the SeqCode Registry after it has
already been published. This allows to retrospectively capture names from the
published literature.

## Path 3
Refers to the concomitant publication of a name during peer-review in concert
with participating journals.
