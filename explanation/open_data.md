## Data Release

All data captured by the SeqCode Registry is intended for immediate or eventual
public release. However, entries have one of three levels of visibility:

1. **Private**: The data and metadata associated to name and register list
   entries in **draft** status (under preparation) are only visible to the
   submitters themselves and the Registry curator team. However, the name might
   be listed in some pages: *e.g.*, in the genome page or among children of the
   parent taxon (if the name of the parent taxon is public). Private pages
   indicate they are private with a crossed-eye icon
   <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"> </i> under the page title (top-left).
2. **Unlisted**: Register lists that are **submitted**, **endorsed**, or
   **notified** are not listed in the Registry and therefore cannot be found
   publicly linked in the portal. However, using the direct link to the register
   list (*i.e.*, the SeqCode Accession) allows anyone to view the data and
   metadata in the list. This allows authors to include the SeqCode Accession of
   prepared lists in their manuscript submissions for peer review, without
   making the entry findable before publication. Note that in most cases the
   names will be listed in the register list, together with their rank, status,
   and nomenclatural type, but all other data will remain inaccessible unless
   the names themselves are public.
3. **Public**: The data and metadata associated to name and register list
   entries in **validated** status (validly published), as well as names with
   the status of **automated discovery** are fully accessible to all portal
   users, including unregistered visitors. All other entries in the system are
   also public, including genome and publication pages. All public data in the
   SeqCode Registry is available in the portal under the terms of the 
   [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   (Creative Commons Attribution version 4.0).

### Data sources and repositories

The SeqCode Registry is not a primary repository for genomic data, and genome
sequences are not stored directly. Genome sequences must be available in INSDC
before an entry can be created, and the Registry only stores metadata associated
to these genomes. In addition, data for some entries, including publications,
authors, and some names, is directly retrieved from third-party providers, and
links are included in the corresponding pages when appropriate. Of note:

- Some data from publications and authors might be automatically retrieved
  through the APIs of [CrossRef](https://crossref.org/),
  [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), and
  [ROR](https://ror.org/)
- Some data and metadata from genomes might be automatically retrieved through
  the APIs of [NCBI](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [EBI](https://ebi.ac.uk/), and
  [MiGA](http://microbial-genomes.org/)
- Some data from names might be automatically retrieved through the APIs of
  [ITIS](https://www.itis.gov/), [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/),
  [IRMNG](https://www.irmng.org), [CoL](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/),
  [LPSN](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/), [NCBI](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and
